# Mp3Tag
The universal tag editor

https://www.mp3tag.de/en/

# History

This repowas imported from https://aur.archlinux.org/mp3tag.git

As the current version of AUR mp3tag is broken (and is currently flagged 'out of date') I am unable
to push any fixes as I'm not a maintainer/co-maintainer of this package. Therefore I imported the
repo here to make some fixes so I can install and use Mp3Tag.


# Instructions

1. Clone this repo
2. CD into the project directory.
3. Build and install the package:

   makepkg -i --install

4. Now test by running mp3tag from the command line (or your favourite application launcher)
